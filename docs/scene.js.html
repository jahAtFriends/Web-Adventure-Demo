/**
* &lt;em>The Scene class is part of the Create Your Own Adventure Project
* for the course Web Design and Development.&lt;/em>
* &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
* A "Create Your Own Adventure" story is, essentially, a collection
* of individual &lt;em> Scenes &lt;/em>. There is some initial scene which
* branches off into 2 possible subsequent scenes, depending on the user's
* selection. From this new scene, two more choices are presented so that
* there are a variety of paths through the story which can be traversed
* depending on the selections made.
* &lt;br/>
* &lt;br/>
*
* This class deines an object which represents the scenes of a CYOA story.
* Each scene contains some html to be injected into a story page. They
* also contain references to two other possible scenes (termed left and right)
* that can be selected by the user.
*
* To create the HTML code for a given scene, you should first save each scene
* as an HTML file (omitting the &lt;code>&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code>
* tags). Ensure that &lt;em>all&lt;/em> scene files are in the same directory. This is
* known as the "base" or "data" directory in this class, and it is uniform
* accross &lt;em> all &lt;/em> Scene objects. To set the base directory, use the
* command:
* &lt;br/>
* &lt;br/>
* &lt;code> Scene.setDataPath("path-to-scene-html-files"); &lt;/code>
* &lt;br/>
* &lt;br/>
* It is recommended to use &lt;em>relative&lt;/em> paths. In this case, we mean relative
* to the file into which this script is being imported. By default the base-path
* is "./" which is suitable if the scene html files are in the same directory
* as the importing html file.
*

    * Constructs a new Scene with the given properties. By default, a sample
    * HTML content will be inserted and left and right scenes are self-referential.
    * &lt;br/>
    * &lt;br/>
    * See examples below. Note that HTML content is loaded into the scene &lt;em>asyncrounously&lt;/em>,
    * so that it is possible that the a call to display the first scene will occur &lt;em>before&lt;/em>
    * that scene has finished loading. This will result in the display of the incorrect (default)
    * html text. See example 2 for more specifics.
    * To avoid this, consider displaying the first scene after the user clicks a button.
    * For most scenes, this will provide plenty of delay to ensure loading completes.
    * Otherwise, it is supported to display the first scene when it has fully loaded using
    * a callback function. See example 3 for details.
    *
    * @param {string} fileneame - The filename of the corresponding html file (relative
    * to the base-path of the Scene class)
    * @param {Scene} left - The Scene that will be progressed to by choosing the "left"
    * option on the current Scene. By default, each Scene is its own left scene.
    * @param {Scene} right - The Scene that will be progressed to by choosing the "right"
    * option on the current Scene. By default, each Scene is its own right scene.
    * @param {onLoadCallback} cb - A function to run when the HTML file is fully loaded.
    *
    * @example &lt;caption> Example 1: Creating a mini-story&lt;/caption>
    * //Creates a 3 Scene story
    * let scene3 = new Scene("scene3.html"); //By default, this scene links back to itself
    * let scene2 = new Scene("scene2.html"); //This scene also has two self-links
    * let scene1 = new Scene("scene1.html", scene2, scene3);
    *
    * @example &lt;caption> Example 2: Caution with importation &lt;/caption>
    * //Likely to result in example html although the import succeeded.
    * let scene1 = new Scene("scene1.html", scene2, scene3);
    * document.getElementById.innerHTML = scene1.getHTML(); //Runs before html load completes
    *
    * @example &lt;caption> Example 3: Callback to handle first scene &lt;/caption>
    *
    * let cb = function() {
    *   document.getElementById.innerHTML = scene1.getHTML();
